This is a volunteer educational project. This project aims to collect data such as articles, posts, photos, etc., as well as announcements of upcoming events.
For the client side, I use React and for the server side, I use Node.js/Express.js to connect to MongoDB.
Now the project is in the final stage to improve the design. After that, I will implement the design in my code.
I am now in the final stage of improving the design, and once that's complete, I will implement it into my code. The goal is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing platform for users to access educational content.
